BEST NOTES EVAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

Git Shell is what we used to create the folders, redirect to another folder and create files
Some of the commands are listed as :
cd /   - This allowed us to move to another folder/root
	ex : cd users/student/documents
	moved us to users/student/documents/
	cd ara_zedrick
	moved us to users/student/documents/ara_zedrick
cd ..  - This allowed us to move up a folder
Mkdir <folder>  - allowed us to make folders
Touch <filename - allowed us to create files
ls - list directories

Revised Notes

/// HTML Structure ///

Tag: the html syntax
	<a> // open tag
	</a> // closing tag

Elements: type of HTML tags
	<p></p> // paragraph element

Two Types of Elements
	<div></div> // block element
	<span></span> // inline elements

[[[ HTML PAGE STRUCTURE ]]]
All html pages must incldue:

ID and Classes are elements
div class "container
class is a attribute of a div
	You can have multiple at once!
	div id "???" gives ??? can only use it once

<div class="Content">
	<h2> title
	<h6> date
	<div class="article">
		<h3>
			<P>

ID=#First
Class= .Container
Can't link to classes (Doesn't look pretty)

HTML // Hypertext Markup Language

===============================================================
8/26/16 Day 7

We made a bob_the_builder folder in our root folder
We put a index.html inside of it

View -> Layout -> Split screens :D

Type HTML and press Tab!
lang is a attribute <html lang="en"> (anything green)

. gives class
Pressing TAB will write the tags for you
ex : a (Press tab) will come out as <a href="">
<table></table> rows and columns
<tr></tr> rows
<td></td> columns

Review:

Link to external sheet in head

Paragraph element with id first
<p id="first"> </p> 

div element with a class of wrapper
<div class="wrapper"> </div>

div class blue and article
<div class="article blue"> </div>

You can seperate classes by putting a space in between them!

H1 {color:blue}
selector {property:value}

Really Important CSS Concepts

Project/index.html
/CSS/styles.css
/image
../image/img.png

../ // is a relative path

Two Types of Elements
inline element
block element

display:inline // Inline elements can have border, padding, margin, width, and height properties. However, the parent element will ignore the child elements' width, vertical padding, and margin in the layout. Also notice what happens when you have a small mobile layout (shrink your browser). This is usually not desireable.

display:block // Block elements can have border, padding, margin, width, and height properties. The parent element will retain the child elements' vertical padding and margin in the layout. Elements with display:block are 100% width, unless a width is set.

display:inline-block // Inline-Block elements can have border, padding, margin, width, and height properties. The parent element will retain the vertical padding and margin of the child elements in the layout. Elements with display:inline-block are the width of their content, unless the width property is set.

Benefits of inline-block

Using the inline-block display property for group of items, there are 3 nice things that happen with your items. If your boxes are all the same height...

your items can have an automatic width
when the items fills up the entire horizontal space, overflowing items all start lining up below automatically
if the parent element has the property text-align:center, the elements that drop down are centered

Multi-Column Layouts with the float property:

The structure for a 2-column float-based layout contains:

outer container: must have a .clearfix class (or a clear:both property).
inner containers: margins and widths must not exceed total of 100%
inner containers: box-sizing:border-box
inner containers: float:left or float:right

The box-sizing property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate width and height of the elements. It is possible to use this property to emulate the behavior of browsers that do not correctly support the CSS box model specification.

REMEMBER TO PUT THIS IN THE <head></head> NOT <header></header>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Title of Whatever</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/styles.css">
	</head>

CTRL+SHIFT+D


position: relative; //RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD SO DESCRIPTIVE

margin: 10px auto;

git clone

git remote -v // list your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change

git remote set-url origin // changes your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the command
