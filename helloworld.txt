BEST NOTES EVAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

Git Shell is what we used to create the folders, redirect to another folder and create files
Some of the commands are listed as :
cd /   - This allowed us to move to another folder/root
	ex : cd users/student/documents
	moved us to users/student/documents/
	cd ara_zedrick
	moved us to users/student/documents/ara_zedrick
cd ..  - This allowed us to move up a folder
Mkdir <folder>  - allowed us to make folders
Touch <filename - allowed us to create files
ls - list directories

Really Important CSS Concepts

Project/index.html
/CSS/styles.css
/image
../image/img.png

../ // is a relative path

Two Types of Elements
inline element
block element

display:inline // Inline elements can have border, padding, margin, width, and height properties. However, the parent element will ignore the child elements' width, vertical padding, and margin in the layout. Also notice what happens when you have a small mobile layout (shrink your browser). This is usually not desireable.

display:block // Block elements can have border, padding, margin, width, and height properties. The parent element will retain the child elements' vertical padding and margin in the layout. Elements with display:block are 100% width, unless a width is set.

display:inline-block // Inline-Block elements can have border, padding, margin, width, and height properties. The parent element will retain the vertical padding and margin of the child elements in the layout. Elements with display:inline-block are the width of their content, unless the width property is set.

Benefits of inline-block

Using the inline-block display property for group of items, there are 3 nice things that happen with your items. If your boxes are all the same height...

your items can have an automatic width
when the items fills up the entire horizontal space, overflowing items all start lining up below automatically
if the parent element has the property text-align:center, the elements that drop down are centered

Multi-Column Layouts with the float property:

The structure for a 2-column float-based layout contains:

outer container: must have a .clearfix class (or a clear:both property).
inner containers: margins and widths must not exceed total of 100%
inner containers: box-sizing:border-box
inner containers: float:left or float:right

The box-sizing property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate width and height of the elements. It is possible to use this property to emulate the behavior of browsers that do not correctly support the CSS box model specification.

REMEMBER TO PUT THIS IN THE <head></head> NOT <header></header>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Title of Whatever</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/styles.css">
	</head>

CTRL+SHIFT+D


position: relative; //RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD SO DESCRIPTIVE

margin: 10px auto;

git clone

git remote -v // list your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change

git remote set-url origin // changes your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the command

Explain Responsive Design. Give an example of responsive design
A responsive design or “responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.”

One example of responsive design is Google Docs. Google Docs is available for laptops, desktops and even mobile devices like phones and works practically the same as others.

Explain media queries

Break poitns in CSS that tell your app to change according to screensize
"Break Points"
To make your website responsive to different sites
“A media query consists of an optional media type and zero or more expressions that limit the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. Media queries, added in CSS3, let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself.”	
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries
	
Give an example of a media query in code for medium screens
	/* ----------- Non-Retina Screens ----------- */
	@media screen 
	  and (min-device-width: 1200px) 
	  and (max-device-width: 1600px) 
	  and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1) { 
	}

	/* ----------- Retina Screens ----------- */
	@media screen 
	  and (min-device-width: 1200px) 
	  and (max-device-width: 1600px) 
	  and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2)
	  and (min-resolution: 192dpi) {

What is em in css? How do you convert px to em?
Units of measure in CSS that adjusts to parent times 150%. Use em in responsive design and pixels on static pages

In CSS, an em unit is equal to the computed font-size for the element to which the em is applied. When em units are declared on child elements that don’t have a font-size defined, they will inherit their font-size from their parent, or from another ancestor element, possibly going all the way back to the root element on the document.
///////////////////////////////////////////////

By using the equation target divided by context (usually 16 px) equals result, you can convert px to em. So if your desired font size was 30 px, you plug that into the equation (30/16)=1.875 em. This means that the font will be 1.875 times bigger than the original font size (1).

Multiply by 1.5

Give an example and explain pseudo class selectors.

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

hover
before & after
focus
in-range
invalid

Give an example of mobile design
Web App designed
	a. What makes the design an effective for mobile
	Media Queries/Simple to use
	b. What makes the design ineffective for mobile (what is is missing)
	Media Queries

Explain and give an example of specificity in CSS
Used to design a special state

divtest span (color:green)
div span (color:blue)
span (color:red)

It will take the green color since its more specific!

Javascript Basics
=> slides.com/ifang/javascriptbasics
=> http://jsbin.com/ 
=> http://slides.com/sgnl/js-basics#/

Why use Javascript? What does it do for us?
=> Makes your sites interactive

Variables
=> Variables are storage containers for various values; building blocks of code
=> In JavaScript, we create a variable with the keyword "var", followed by the name of the variable, to indicate that we're making a variable.
=> Examples:
- var myName = "Bob";
- var number = 1;
- var booleanExample = false;

=> All variables must have values of a certain data type!
=> If you have an alphanueric sequence, like 12312JCK32, since it is not a number or a boolean, it is a string. And if something is a string, it must be in Quotes
=> ","" are both fine, however be consistent with your use of quotes; do not switch between single and double
=> Spaces count as a variable

Legal Variable Names
=> Must follow certain rules (Don't do the following!)
1. Begin variable names with a number. (var 53cats = "there are fifty three cats";)
2. Use special symbols or mathematical operators (+,-,$,@,#,&,|,.{},(),,[],;,,:)
3. Have spaces in variable names (var the cat = "bob";)

When you console.log(); something you can see how the computer sees the code

---------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
var firstName = "Jon";
var lastName = "Tan";

console.log(firstName);

Console - "Jon"

console.log("Jon"+" "+"Tan"); OR
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);

Console - "Jon Tan"

console.log(dylan);

Console - Error! (not defined)

console.log (12 - 6) ;

Console - 6

------------------------------------------------------------

=> Variable names don't need strings
=> Sentences do!

Conditional Statements
=> Very intuitive
=> Conditional statements are blocks of code that say, "if  (some condition evaluates to true), then do some code"
=> What does the code below do?

---------------------------------------------------------------

var cat = "Mr. Whiskers";

if (cat == "Reynald") {
    console.log("died in a tragic car accident");
} else if (cat == "Sammy") {
    console.log("killed in a violent fight");
} else if (cat == "Mikey") {
    console.log("went up in flames in a gas station explosion");
} else {
    console.log("was gluttonous, and choked on a fish bone");
}

Console: "was gluttonous, and choked on a fish bone"

----------------------------------------------------------------

= VS ==
=> = is assignment
 - we use = to assign values to variables
 - ex. var x = 5;
=> == checks for the equality of two expressions

-----------------------------------------------------------------

var x = 3;
var y = 4;
console.log (x == y);
Console - false

var x = y
console.log(x);
Console - 4

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Boolean Operators
=> == is an example of a Boolean operator
=> Other Boolean operators:
 - !== not equals
 - > greater than 
 - < less than 
 - >= greater than or equal to 
 - <= less than or equal to 
=> They're called Boolean operators because they're used to evaluate if expressions are true or false

Logical Operators
=> && - and 
=> || - or
=> ! - not; put in front of expressions to negate them
=> Combine with Boolean operators to create more complex expressions 
=> You can also nest conditional statements within each other

HTML => structure
CSS => decoraction
Javascript => functionality
