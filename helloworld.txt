Git Shell is what we used to create the folders, redirect to another folder and create files
Some of the commands are listed as :
cd /   - This allowed us to move to another folder/root
	ex : cd users/student/documents
	moved us to users/student/documents/
	cd ara_zedrick
	moved us to users/student/documents/ara_zedrick
cd ..  - This allowed us to move up a folder
Mkdir <folder>  - allowed us to make folders
Touch <filename - allowed us to create files
ls - list directories
